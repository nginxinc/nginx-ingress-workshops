The Hands-On Lab Exercises are designed to build upon each other, adding additional services and features as you progress through them.  `It is important to complete the lab exercises in sequential order.`

By the end of this Workshop, you will have a working, operational NGINX Plus Ingress Controller, with the skills to deploy and operate one for your Modern Application Kubernetes projects.
