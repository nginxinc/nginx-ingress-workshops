# Advanced NGINX Plus Ingress Controller Workshop

<br/>

>>**Under Construction!!**

<br/>

## Welcome!

<br/>

> ><strong>Welcome to the Advanced NGINX Plus Workshop for NGINX Ingress Controller (NIC)!</strong>

<br/>

This Workshop will introduce Advanced Topics for **`NGINX Plus Ingress Controller`** with hands-on practice through self-guided lab exercises.

You will learn how to configure an NGINX Plus Ingress Controller's advanced features, break it, fix it, scale it up and down and monitor it in realtime.  You will deploy new apps and services in your private cluster, terminate SSL, route HTTP traffic, set up Deep Insights, JSON Web Token authentication to running pods and services.  You will also administer other infrastructure services that are required in today's Modern Application architectures, like DNS, SSL certificate manager, Identity Providers, and other services.  Experience with these types of systems is helpful but not required for this workshop.

These Hands-On Lab Exercises are designed to be stand alone, self contained exercises.

It is `HIGHLY recommended` that you first complete the Nginx Ingress Controller Workshop first, you will need that knowledge and expertise to complete these exercises successfully.

By the end of a lab exercise, you will have a working, operational NGINX Plus Ingress Controller, routing traffic to and from Kubernetes application pods and services, with the necessary skills to deploy and operate NIC for your own Modern Applications running in Kubernetes.  Thank You for taking the time to attend this NGINX Workshop!

NGINX Ingress Controller has the best-in-class traffic management solution for cloud‑native apps in Kubernetes and containerized environments. In a recent 
[CNCF](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2018/08/29/cncf-survey-use-of-cloud-native-technologies-in-production-has-grown-over-200-percent/)
survey, nearly two‑thirds of respondents reported using the NGINX Ingress Controller, more than all other controllers combined – and NGINX Ingress Controller has been downloaded more than [50 million
times](https://hub.docker.com/r/nginx/nginx-ingress) from DockerHub.
