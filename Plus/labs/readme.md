# NGINX Plus Ingress Controller Workshop

<br/>

## Welcome!

<br/>

> ><strong>Welcome to the NGINX Plus Workshop for NGINX Ingress Controller (NIC)!</strong>

<br/>

This Workshop will introduce **`NGINX Plus Ingress Controller`** with hands-on practice through self-paced lab exercises.

You will learn how to configure an NGINX Plus Ingress Controller, deploy it on a Kubernetes cluster, configure advanced NGINX Plus features, loadtest it, scale it up and down and monitor it in realtime.  You will deploy new apps and services in your private cluster, terminate SSL, route HTTP traffic, configure redirects, set up healthchecks, and load balance traffic to running pods.

These Hands-On Lab Exercises are designed to build upon each other, adding additional services and features as you progress through them, completing the labs in sequential order is required.

By the end of this Workshop, you will have a working, operational NGINX Plus Ingress Controller, routing traffic to and from Kubernetes application pods and services, with the necessary skills to deploy and operate NIC for your own Modern Applications running in Kubernetes.  Thank You for taking the time to attend this NGINX Workshop!

NGINX Ingress Controller has the best-in-class traffic management solution for cloud‑native apps in Kubernetes and containerized environments. In a recent 
[CNCF](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2018/08/29/cncf-survey-use-of-cloud-native-technologies-in-production-has-grown-over-200-percent/)
survey, nearly two‑thirds of respondents reported using the NGINX Ingress Controller, more than all other controllers combined – and NGINX Ingress Controller has been downloaded more than [50 million
times](https://hub.docker.com/r/nginx/nginx-ingress) from DockerHub.
