# Workshop pre-work
## Prep for your upcoming F5/NGINX workshop! 

If you're here that probably means you are currently in, or registered for, an upcoming NGINX workshop. By taking the time to run through this exercise you are helping us save time during the workshop and ensure that you meet the prerequisites to access the workshop. We appreciate you taking time to check your access.

## Step 0: If this is your first time in a Workshop
Look for an email from **`courses@notify.udf.f5.com`**. This will have instructions on how you can login into UDF(F5 workshop environment).

### If you cannot find your invite email ("UDF Course Registration:NGINXperts Lab ...") STOP
  * These commonly get caught by spam filters. *Make sure to check your spam folder **and** your system's email Quarantine.*
  * If you still cannot find your invite email, you either have not been invited to a workshop or we have an incorrect email. Please get help from whoever sent you to this page.

## Step 1: Get yourself to UDF

- Navigate to https://udf.f5.com/ and select `Invited Users`

- If this is your first time using UDF, use the `Sign Up` link which would take your to F5 registration page. NOTE: this will *not be the password to the Jumphost or other VMs in the class!* 
    ![Sign up](media/F5signup.png)

- Once you have filled in your registration details, you should be receiving an `Account Activation` email as shown below
  ![Account Activation Email](media/F5accountactivationemail.png)

- When you click on the `Activate Account` button within the activation email, you would be redirected to setup 2 factor authentication as shown below. Select your preferred authentication method.

- Once you have set up 2 factor authentication successfully, you will see a `green` checkmark on your preferred method. Click on `Finish`.

- If you already have an account but you can't remember your password, simply reset your password by clicking on `Forgot Password?` link.

## Step 2: Start the course

- Once logged into UDF, click `Launch` (This will open a new tab.)
  ![Non F5](media/courselist.png "click launch")

- And then click on `Join`

- Click the `DEPLOYMENT` tab at the top

## Step 3: RDP to the Jumpbox
   * username: `ubuntu`
   * password: `Nginx123`

THIS REQUIRES AN RDP CLIENT! If you have a Mac *and* haven't downloaded an RDP client before, here is the first-party version:

[Microsoft's RDP client on the Apple Apps Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-remote-desktop/id1295203466?mt=12)

- Now we just have to wait for the Jumpbox to finish booting. . .
![Non F5](media/waitforboot.png "loading. . .")

- Make sure to select a small enough resolution to see the whole screen.
![Non F5](media/launchrdp.png "almost there")

- Once you select the resolution, your browser will download an rdp file. Open this file to connect to jumphost.

- Accept the self-signed cert, and jumphost username and password will be `ubuntu` and `Nginx123`. <br/>(**NOTE:** This is *not* your UDF login username & password.)

### If you can't connect to the Jumphost, _remember to shut off your VPN_, or join a non-proxied network (sometimes a guest network in the office will work).

### For machines running Windows and attached to a domain, Windows will helpfully attempt to use your domain creds to log in, and you'll see:
![Non F5](media/domaincreds.png "everyone has credentials.com email accounts right?")

### Click "More choices" to enter both a username and a password.

That wraps the pre-requisites.
