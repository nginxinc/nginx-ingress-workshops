## NGINX Ingress Controller Workshop

<br/>

> ><strong>Welcome to the NGINX OSS Workshop for NGINX Ingress Controller (NIC)!</strong>

</br>

## Overview

</br>

This Workshop will introduce the Open Source version of the `NGINX Ingress Controller` with hands-on practice through self-paced lab exercises.  You will learn how to deploy an NGINX Ingress Controller on a Kubernetes cluster, configure basic and advanced NGINX features; and then test it, and monitor it in realtime.

<br/>

The Hands-On Lab Exercises are designed to build upon each other, adding additional services and features as you progress through them.  

`It is important to complete the lab exercises in sequential order.`

By the end of this Workshop, you will have a working, operational NGINX Ingress Controller, with the skills to deploy and operate one for your Modern Application Kubernetes projects.
