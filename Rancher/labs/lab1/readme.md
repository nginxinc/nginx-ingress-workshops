<br/>

   ![lab-guide](media/lab1_lab-guide-rancher.png)

1. Open Visual Studio Code, and prep the layout as follows, (or your preferences).

   > You will be running all the lab exercises in VS Code and its built-in bash Terminal to run commands like `kubectl`, `curl`, `nerdctl` and much more.

   >> Important!  Change the Terminal commandline path to **`"nginx-ingress-workshop/Rancher/labs"`** - all the Lab Exercises are run from this directory.

1. Open the VScode Bash Terminal for the bottom pane, if it is not already open:

   ![vscode-terminal](media/lab1_open-vscode-terminal.png)

1. Using the VScode Terminal (the bottom pane), go ahead a try a `kubectl` command, such as `kubectl get nodes`:

   ```bash
   kubectl get nodes
   ```

      Verify your Kubernetes Cluster is up and the Rancher lima Node is in the "Ready" state:

      ![kubectl get nodes](media/lab1_rancher-ready.png)
   

      **NOTE:** If your Node is not showing in `Ready` status, you must fix it before proceeding.

**This completes this Lab.**
