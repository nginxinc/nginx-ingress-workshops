# Starter K8s Dev Environment
The purpose of this exercise is to offer a simple and easily accessible way to set up basic dev tools and a local Kubernetes cluster to allow a beginner a low risk way to work with and learn Kubernetes concepts using the open source Ingress controller from NGINX Inc. All from the comfort of your own laptop.

This setup will act as a foundation for future explorations into NGINX solutions, GitOps, and the Kubernetes ecosystem.

```

**Set the theme to agnoster or amuse**
Open the zshrc with VI
```
vi .zshrc
```
```
# Set name of the theme to load --- if set to "random", it will
# load a random theme each time oh-my-zsh is loaded, in which case,
# to know which specific one was loaded, run: echo $RANDOM_THEME
# See https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Themes
ZSH_THEME="agnoster"<---ChangeThis
```

#### Install Powerline fonts from Nerd Fonts  
[Website](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads)

Install a powerline enabled font, I use mononoki
```
brew tap homebrew/cask-fonts &&
brew install --cask font-mononoki-nerd-font
```

**Set font type in VScode/VSCodium**
- Open the command pallet View > Command Pallet
- Type "settings" and select the Preferences: Open Settings (UI) option.
- In the search field type "terminal font"
- Under Terminal > Integrated: Font Family paste the following in the empty text field
- "Mononoki Nerd Font Mono"
- Set the font size from 12 to 16 (optional)

#### Install FIG
[Website](https://fig.io/download)

Install FIG using Homebrew
```
brew install --cask fig
```

**Check for the FIG extension in VSCode**
Once installed fig should work out of the box after a couple minor changes.

- You will need to login to it, I just use SSO via my GitHub account, you may opt for an alternative method.
- Fig requires permission to be enabled in Systems Settings > Privacy & Security > Accessability, tick the option next to fig.
- You will need to restart VSCode as well for it to work with the terminal window

**note:** if you continue to run into issues you may need to run the following commands, and follow any instructions that it recommends.

```
fig doctor
```

<br>

## Pull the NGINX Ingress workshop repo from GitHub

**Via command line**

- Open a new terminal via the Terminal > New Terminal menu at the top fo the VSCode window.
- Change directories to the root location you would like to store your GitHub source

**note:** This will be different for each user you will need to establish this location I use the location below.
```
cd Documents/source/github/
```

**note:** you will need to create this location if it does not exist prior to cloning the repo

- List itemClone the github repo below
```
git clone https://github.com/nginxinc/nginx-ingress-workshops.git
```

**Note:** If you would like to specify the folder name use the command below and substitute your own name

```
git clone https://github.com/nginxinc/nginx-ingress-workshops.git [your folder name here]
```

Now we have the working repo cloned, we can begin working on building out our Kubernetes dev environment. For this exercise we will only be using the content found in the repo location below.

```
cd Rancher/
```

<br>

## Local K3s Devopment Environment
#### Install Rancher Desktop
[Website](https://rancherdesktop.io)

**Steps**
- Download the binary for your Mac type and run the .dmg
- Drag Rancher Desktop (RDT) into the applications folder.
- Run Rancher Desktop from the Mac Launcher.
- Once it launches a popup window will appear that allows you make settings to the local K3s cluster.
- Deselect the option to deploy K3s for now.

**Deploy the override.yaml**
This is required to turn off the internal load balancer Klipper in RDT.

- Locate the overide.yaml file in our the git repo location below.
```
cd Rancher/source/rdt/
```
- Copy it to the directory below
```
/Users/[Your User Name Here]/Library/Application Support/rancher-desktop/lima/_config
```

**Final settings and launch for Kubernetes on RDT**
- From the rancher menu select preferences.
- Locate and switch to the "Virtual Machine" tab.
	- Set memory to 8 gb if possible
	- Set CPUs to 4 if possible
- Locate and switch to the Kubernetes tab
	- Check the box next to enable Kubernetes
	- Uncheck the box next to Traefik
	- Click apply and allow RDT to finish loading

- Once this process finishes you will have a base cluster  with no ingress or Load balancer defined to work with.

#### Add two K8s focused extensions to VSCode

**Steps**
- Navigate to the extesions UI in VSCode
- search for Kubernetes
- Install the Kubernetes extesion from MS
- The YAML one from Red Hat should automaticall install with the MS one.
- Navigate to the K8s UI by clicking on the kubernetes logo in the left navigation bar.
- Validate the the Rancher cluster showes up in the first panel

#### Install k9s
[Website](https://k9scli.io)

Via Homebrew
```
 brew install derailed/k9s/k9s
```

To start k9s just open a terminal session in VSCode, I like to put mine in the top window in vscode, and type.


```
k9s
```

**note:** VSCode may require a restart after this if k9s is not showing the K8s cluster properly. Also, nothing will show up until the local single node cluster for Rancher Desktop is active.

#### Install Metal LB
[Website](https://metallb.universe.tf)

Deploy MetalLB
```
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/metallb/metallb/v0.13.9/config/manifests/metallb-native.yaml
```

Create and Apply the following manifests to add your IP range

**note:** you will need to set aside a bank on your local network.
note: these are already created in the repo just update the addresses to suite your environment apply the manifests

IPAddressPool.yaml
```
apiVersion: metallb.io/v1beta1
kind: IPAddressPool
metadata:
  name: first-pool
  namespace: metallb-system
spec:
  addresses:
  - 192.168.1.95-192.168.1.99
```

L2Advertisement.yaml
```
apiVersion: metallb.io/v1beta1
kind: L2Advertisement
metadata:
  name: example
  namespace: metallb-system
spec:
  ipAddressPools:
  - first-pool
```

Run the following commands
```
kubectl apply -f IPAddressPool.yaml
kubectl apply -f L2Advertisement.yaml
```

#### Install NGINX OSS Ingress via Helm
[Website](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-ingress-controller/installation/)

Install using helm (preferred)
or
Install using manifests

Add the NGINX repo
```
helm repo add nginx-stable https://helm.nginx.com/stable
```

Update via Helm
```
helm repo update
```

Create NGINX namespace
```
kubectl create namespace nginx-ingress
```

Install NGINX Ingress controller
```
kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=nginx-ingress
```
Base Helm command
```
helm install my-release nginx-stable/nginx-ingress
```

Helm command to support this workshop
```
helm install nic nginx-stable/nginx-ingress --namespace nginx-ingress --set controller.nginxStatus.enable=true --set controller.customPorts[0].containerPort=9000 --set controller.nginxStatus.port=9000 --set controller.nginxStatus.allowCidrs=0.0.0.0/0 --set prometheus.create=true
```

Helm with custom port and ConfigMap:

```
helm install nic nginx-stable/nginx-ingress --namespace nginx-ingress --set controller.nginxStatus.enable=true --set controller.customPorts[0].containerPort=9000 --set controller.nginxStatus.port=9000 --set controller.nginxStatus.allowCidrs=0.0.0.0/0 --set prometheus.create=true --set controller.customConfigMap=nic-nginx-config --set controller.enableSnippets=true
```

Note: "my-release" can be changed to any name.  It is important to use the name "nic" for this workshop.

Uninstall NGINX Ingress Controller

```
helm uninstall ny-release
or
helm uninstall nic
```

Validate that the nginx service was properly assigned an External-IP while in the "nic" namespace run the following
```
kubectl get all -n nginx-ingress
```

You should see somthing similar to the following
```
NAME                                     READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
pod/nic-nginx-ingress-55dd46fcf9-smvng   1/1     Running   0          62s

NAME                        TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP    PORT(S)                      AGE
service/nic-nginx-ingress   LoadBalancer   10.43.171.131   10.1.1.100   80:30888/TCP,443:31517/TCP   62s

NAME                                READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
